To run a PHP file in your browser from VSCode on Ubuntu, you need to follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Install PHP: Open your terminal and run the following command to install PHP:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php
```
**Step 2.** Install Apache or Use PHP's Built-in Server
- Option A: Install Apache: Apache is a popular web server. You can install it using:
```
sudo apt install apache2
```
After installation, place your PHP files in the _**/var/www/html**_ directory. You can access your PHP scripts by navigating to http://localhost/yourfile.php in your browse

- Option B: Use PHP's Built-in Server: PHP comes with a built-in web server that is useful for development and testing. To use it, navigate to the directory containing your PHP file and run:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
This will start a web server on localhost at port 8000. You can access your PHP files in your browser at http://localhost:8000/yourfile.php.
